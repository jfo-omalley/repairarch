# Repair.Arch: A Speculative Archive of Repairs

[Link to the Repair.Arch site][1]

Repair.Arch documents futures that might result from the work of repair -- repair of the earth, of communities, and of technology -- conducted by activist communities today in the wake of major social and environmental changes. Repair.Arch aspires to a post-colonial framework, imagining social/technological futures in partnership with global and multi-species stakeholders. 

This ReadMe exposes the theory and structure underneath the web-hosted Repair.Arch artifact. The purpose of the exposure is to open the work to the repair of its own failures in imagination and perspective. I hope that, as you take time to learn more about the project, you will consider using the method to contribute your own perspective -- a biographical prototype, modular tech design, or speculative collective action -- in whatever way feels most reparative (or provocative) of your experience. 

## Background

Repair.Arch consists of one designed object: the archive itself. Archiving is an enduring form of information design. Most archives conform to the same intellectual and descriptive standards and rely on similar technologies designed to provide different levels of mediated access. In a traditional archive, users might encounter that access in the form of a static finding aid, which points to objects without making them available. A more technologically sophisticated archive, such as the software emulation library on the Internet Archive, can offer users more robust access to the objects.

From the perspective of preservation, not all of these solutions are equal. Much of the information stored on optical media or on networks has disappeared. As technology gathers and generates more information, it heightens the scale of what can be lost. In other technological formats, information persists more reliably. Micro-film remains stable for hundreds of year. Even paper has proven it will outlast our hard drives. 

Within both digital and traditional archives, archivists capture and generate another kind of knowledge: information about information. In digital archives, this comes in the form of metadata; in a more traditional setting, in letters and diaries. Here enters the technological concept of the finding aid, an informational map of information about what may irrevocably lost.

Repair most obviously links to archives through preservation and conservation. Clearly, preservation extends the life of the object in all its forms, thereby extending the useful life of the archive. But repair can, and often does, happen on a very personal level: copying out, refoldering, rebinding, even destroying. In the archive, acts of repair, which must happen under the delicate motions of human hands, turn the dry, oppressive labor of information labor into care.

Repair likewise links archives to the outside world. As archives use technology, guard access, and consume resources, they can often serve to hide the historical evidence of the same extractive processes conducted on a global scale. Post-custodial, post-colonial archives have to find ways to participate in global efforts to liberate people by liberating information. Inspired by the wave of creative methods to fix, repurpose, renew, make, hack, narrativize, speculate, reuse, and refuse, all information stewards can attempt to repair their broken technical and information structures. 

How do will tinkering and sharing address algorithmic oppression, resource extraction, or technologically driven mass extinction? Repair.Arch repurposes information, technical, and design methods as both a form of active response and attempt to make information about the information needed to affect that transformation? 
 
## Structure

Repair.Arch consists of two parts: an information structure and a technical structure. 

### Information

The information model mimics the approach of a traditional finding aid. The primary inversion comes in the form of time, as the archive uses different methods and styles to generate information about information, in the form of speculative or fictional designs. 

As with traditional finding aids, the nested structure has three levels, which each repeat the same structure. More information is available through the [DACS Standard][2]. Repurposing these traditional information elements to imagine the reuse and renewal of history encourages a perspective on design that emphasizes documentation, possibility, and context.

Collection: the collection level encompasses all the records in the archive. The characteristics of this super-category suggests that all of the records come from the same place and belong together.

Series: typically, a series groups records with a similar functional purpose or common creator, such as organizing the papers of a family by each individual member. Repair.Arch applies this level thematically instead.

Folder: at the folder level, we have the documentation or object itself. Folders can contain, and therefore relate, multiple items. An object can come with its documentation, or multiple fragments can point towards the same idea. Folder contents sometimes have visual representations. 

Description: the description field refers to a general description of the topics and notables related to the level. In Repair.Arch, some descriptions have narrativized substitutions or employ a design method.

Date: the speculative dates.

Extent: the contents. For the collection and the series this refers to the size of the collection i.e. the number of boxes or folders. At the folder level, it refers to the media formats.

Creator: the fictional creator of the record group.

Credit: the present-day contributor of the record. In cases where the original author wrote the entry, the credit line is omitted.

Scope and content: details about the real contents of the record. Most speculative outcomes live here.

Administrative history: think of this as the chain of custody, as well as a field that documents any changes to the record group. Some will be fictional. Other rules are covered in the contribution guidelines. 

### Technical

Repair.Arch runs on the [Jekyll][3] static site generator using the [Ed theme][4]. We prefer to use Jekyll/Ed because these technologies adhere to principles of minimal computing (one of the design methods behind Repair.Arch): reducing complexity, running on low bandwidth, and facilitating digital preservation.  

## Methodology

In theory, Repair.Arch collects existing methods that fit its theory of repair and speculates on their future applications through a series of intersecting, functional design methods. 

This section outlines the theory behind those methods and one functional way to speculate with them. The outline describes the current contents of the archive and how they got there, but only has to serve as guidelines or a jumping off point for any future contributions. 

### Repairs

Repair.Arch classifies theories or methods of repair as any design method (real or metaphor) that attempts to "re" design interventions into waste, disposal, and obsolescence, by fixing, saving, or otherwise using the past to imagine or create futures. 

This section outlines a few of the most common methods as examples.

_DIY (Do It Yourself)_

DIY communities empower members to exit the cycle of consumption and waste by designing and building their own technology. We classify it as a method of repair because, on a practical level, DIY often repurposes or reuses components. On a broader level, DIY communities repair social practices around consumption.

_Digital preservation_

We would categorize digital preservation as a repair practice that centers renewal and reuse. By preserving at-risk information in sustainable, durable ways (as well as by making the choice about what losses to accept and how to mitigate waste), digital preservation strategies promote the values of resilience and accessibility.

_Biographical prototypes_

"Under-recognized first-person accounts of design materialized through prototyping practices," perform functional and metaphorical repairs to the harm enacted by the exclusion of disabled communities from design and technical practices. Design practices that shift or challenge dominant perspectives often tend towards reparations. (Bennet)

### Deck

These and other strategies are captured in the Repair.Arch design deck, which brings together three elements.

- The complete inventory of repair methods, as documented through the original design research process.
- Perspectives drawn from the [Liberatory Design Deck][5].
- Other contemporary design methods.

More information about the deck, as well as free copies, is forthcoming.

## Contribution Guidelines

Repair.Arch is a template, not a final product. All submissions that fall within the collecting scope are welcome. Creative and diverse contributions will help Repair.Arch transition from an archive of one limited perspective to a robust, durable document of new ideas.

### Collection Policy

"Shared stewardship (sometimes called “co-curation”) refers to sharing authority, expertise, and responsibility for the respectful attribution, documentation, interpretation, display, care, storage, public access, and disposition of a collection item with the advice of the source community," Robert Leopold, Deputy Director, Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage at the Smithsonian. 

Effective principles for the shared stewardship of  archival digital resources, often thought of as content moderation or through the lens of the availability of digital surrogates of cultural objects, remain elusive. Repair.Arch maintains a collection policy that consists of shared commitments, rather than rules, and seeks to reject the model of expertise encoded into GitHub.

Commitment one -- robust metadata: all contributions to the archive will contain robust metadata in the form of accreditation, citation, and minimum descriptive requirements neccesrary for the long-term digital preservation of elements.

Commitment two -- open moderation: the responsibility of archivists is to respond actively to submission requests by soliciting questions, feedback, and other contributions rather than passively accept or reject submissions. 

Commitment three -- shared stewardship: this policy is open to feedback and change. Any contributor has the power to suggest changes to the collection policy at any time.

### Ways to Contribute

There are essentially two ways to contribute to Repair.Arch: contributing new methods or adding content to series or folders.

#### Adding New Methods

Users can contribute new methods to Repair.Arch by contributing cards to the deck. To make a contribution to the main copy of the deck, hosted on GitHub, the recommended elements are title, description, an example application, and citation. You can cite yourself. You must also categorize it as repair method, a general method, or a perspective, along with a brief rationale. 

#### Adding or Amending Series and Folders

You can submit designs or amendments directly to the archive by editing pages in the "texts" file. These ".md" markdown files are essentially plain text files. Changes will be reviewed, and you can include any metadata elements not captured in your submission in your included comments. If you have an image or other visual component you would like to add, please included that note, as well as link to the image, in the text submission, not the comments. 

## Preservation

Preservation and care of this archive currently relies on the technology provided by GitHub.
