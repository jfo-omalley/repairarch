# Repair.Arch: A Speculative Archive of Repairs

[Link to the Repair.Arch site][1]

Repair.Arch documents futures that might result from the work of repair -- repair of the earth, of communities, and of technology -- conducted by activist communities today in the wake of major social and environmental changes. Repair.Arch aspires to a post-colonial framework, imagining social/technological futures in partnership with global and multi-species stakeholders. 

This ReadMe exposes the theory and structure underneath the web-hosted Repair.Arch artifact. The purpose of the exposure is to open the work to the repair of its own failures in imagination and perspective. I hope that, as you take time to learn more about the project, you will consider using the method to contribute your own perspective -- a biographical prototype, modular tech design, or speculative collective action -- in whatever way feels most reparative (or provocative) of your experience. 

## Background

Repair.Arch consists of one designed object: the archive itself. Archiving is an enduring form of information design. Most archives conform to the same intellectual and descriptive standards and rely on similar technologies designed to provide different levels of mediated access. In a traditional archive, users might encounter that access in the form of a static finding aid, which points to objects without making them available. A more technologically sophisticated archive, such as the software emulation library on the Internet Archive, can offer users more robust access to the objects.

From the perspective of preservation, not all of these solutions are equal. Much of the information stored on optical media or on networks has disappeared. As technology gathers and generates more information, it heightens the scale of what can be lost. In other technological formats, information persists more reliably. Micro-film remains stable for hundreds of year. Even paper has proven it will outlast our hard drives. 

Within both digital and traditional archives, archivists capture and generate another kind of knowledge: information about information. In digital archives, this comes in the form of metadata; in a more traditional setting, in letters and diaries. Here enters the technological concept of the finding aid, an informational map of information about what may irrevocably lost.

Repair most obviously links to archives through preservation and conservation. Clearly, preservation extends the life of the object in all its forms, thereby extending the useful life of the archive. But repair can, and often does, happen on a very personal level: copying out, refoldering, rebinding, even destroying. In the archive, acts of repair, which must happen under the delicate motions of human hands, turn the dry, oppressive labor of information labor into care.

Repair likewise links archives to the outside world. As archives use technology, guard access, and consume resources, they can often serve to hide the historical evidence of the same extractive processes conducted on a global scale. Post-custodial, post-colonial archives have to find ways to participate in global efforts to liberate people by liberating information. Inspired by the wave of creative methods to fix, repurpose, renew, make, hack, narrativize, speculate, reuse, and refuse, all information stewards can attempt to repair their broken technical and information structures. 

How do will tinkering and sharing address algorithmic oppression, resource extraction, or technologically driven mass extinction? Repair.Arch repurposes information, technical, and design methods as both a form of active response and attempt to make information about the information needed to affect that transformation? 
 
## Structure

Repair.Arch consists of two parts: an information structure and a technical structure. 

### Information

The information model mimics the approach of a traditional finding aid. The primary inversion comes in the form of time, as the archive uses different methods and styles to generate information about information, in the form of speculative or fictional designs. 

As with traditional finding aids, the nested structure has three levels, which each repeat the same structure. More information is available through the [DACS Standard][2]. Repurposing these traditional information elements to imagine the reuse and renewal of history encourages a perspective on design that emphasizes documentation, possibility, and context.

Collection: the collection level encompasses all the records in the archive. The characteristics of this super-category suggests that all of the records come from the same place and belong together.

Series: typically, a series groups records with a similar functional purpose or common creator, such as organizing the papers of a family by each individual member. Repair.Arch applies this level thematically instead.

Folder: at the folder level, we have the documentation or object itself. Folders can contain, and therefore relate, multiple items. An object can come with its documentation, or multiple fragments can point towards the same idea. Folder contents sometimes have visual representations. 

Description: the description field refers to a general description of the topics and notables related to the level. In Repair.Arch, some descriptions have narrativized substitutions or employ a design method.

Date: the speculative dates.

Extent: the contents. For the collection and the series this refers to the size of the collection i.e. the number of boxes or folders. At the folder level, it refers to the media formats.

Creator: the fictional creator of the record group.

Credit: the present-day contributor of the record. In cases where the original author wrote the entry, the credit line is omitted.

Scope and content: details about the real contents of the record. Most speculative outcomes live here.

Administrative history: think of this as the chain of custody, as well as a field that documents any changes to the record group. Some will be fictional. Other rules are covered in the contribution guidelines.
