# Repair.Arch

[Link to the Repair.Arch site][1]

This ReadMe contains instructions on how to use the Repair.Arch design methods deck to contribute. Contributions help repair the project by mitigating failures in imagination and perspective.

## Deck

These and other strategies are captured in the Repair.Arch design deck, which brings together three elements.

- The complete inventory of repair methods, as documented through the original design research process.
- Perspectives drawn from the [Liberatory Design Deck][2].
- What-if scenarios.

Copies of the deck are currently available upon request. 

## Ways to Contribute

There are essentially two ways to contribute to Repair.Arch: contributing new methods or adding content to series or folders.

#### Adding New Methods

Users can contribute new methods to Repair.Arch by contributing cards to the deck. To make a contribution to the main copy of the deck, hosted on GitHub, the recommended elements are title, description, an example application, and citation. You can cite yourself. You must also categorize it as repair method, a general method, or a perspective, along with a brief rationale. 

#### Adding or Amending Series and Folders

You can submit designs or amendments directly to the archive by editing pages in the "texts" file. These ".md" markdown files are essentially plain text files. Changes will be reviewed, and you can include any metadata elements not captured in your submission in your included comments. If you have an image or other visual component you would like to add, please included that note, as well as link to the image, in the text submission, not the comments. 

## Preservation

Preservation and care of this archive currently relies on the technology provided by GitHub.
