# Repair.Arch: A Speculative Archive of Repairs

[Link to the Repair.Arch site][1]

Repair.Arch documents futures that might result from the work of repair -- repair of the earth, of communities, and of technology -- conducted by activist communities today in the wake of major social and environmental changes. Repair.Arch aspires to a post-colonial framework, imagining social/technological futures in partnership with global and multi-species stakeholders. 

This ReadMe exposes the theory and structure underneath the web-hosted Repair.Arch artifact. The purpose of the exposure is to open the work to the repair of its own failures in imagination and perspective. I hope that, as you take time to learn more about the project, you will consider using the method to contribute your own perspective -- a biographical prototype, modular tech design, or speculative collective action -- in whatever way feels most reparative (or provocative) of your experience.
