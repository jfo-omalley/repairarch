<p>Description</p>
<p>The five series collected in this archive document the next five hundred years of efforts at repair. When we talk about repair, we talk about fixing and mending, restoring and rebuilding. Repair works on the level of tools, of hammers and nails. It is a function of patience happening under the watchful eye of attentive affection; we can repair what we cannot touch. Our relationships with one another, our sense of ourselves, the feeling of peace when light hits our closed eyes: we can bring these feelings back to life when we've lost them. Even concepts can renew themselves in language when we take account of how they broke. When we talk about repair, we talk about putting these things right.</p>
<p>This archive exists because the need for repair means something is broken. Each series here speculates on how experimental methods to renew, reuse, or reimagine shared futures might enact a vision of repair. The archive foregrounds the ideas and values emerging from the DIY movement, disabled biographies, and digital preservation as responses to fictional, even impossible changes in society, technology, and the environment. As you explore the archive, let yourself be provoked by the idea of repair, as technique and metaphor, when you imagine your future.</p>
