## Description

Shared computing can turn your computer's downtime into a piece of a super-processor. But if your computer had down time in the first place, why did you pay so much for it? Modular computing starts from the premise that most people have more computational power than they need. When wealthy countries use advanced computation to power extraction from the earth and practice data-drive colonization, reducing computing power becomes a moral and environmental imperative.

## Folder 1: Computing Mutual Aid



*Date*

2025 - 2050, inclusive.
2035 - 2045, bulk.


*Extent*

Flyers, ephemera, optical drives, modular computer processors, network center technical documentation, facilitator correspondence, negatives.

*Creator*

Colorado State Computer CSC (Community Supported Computing)

*Scope and Content*

This folder contains mixed media materials documenting the activities of the Colorado State Computer CSC, primarily from 2035 onward. The documentation includes technical information for the implementation of their modular and shared computing centers, sign-ups. Notable correspondence with globally located CSCs includes partner communities in Kenya, Vietnam, and the Philippines that transitioned from call centers and other customer support professions. 

The digital collection of the archive features an immaculately preserved copy of mixed media from the CSC bulletin board, dated 2040.

Donated in 2050 with consensus permission of former members of the CSC. Processed by the CSC Community Archives Project, hosted on the re-distributed Colorado State intranet.

## Folder 2: Multi-Species Landscaping

*Date*

2500 - 2530

*Extent*

Bird hives, synthetic tree leaves, fungal spores, landscape architecture plans, contracts, pay-stubs, restricted legal documents.

*Creator*

Diller - von Furstenberg Family Foundation
  
*Scope and Content*

A group of landscape architects funded by the Diller - von Furstenberg Family Foundation delivered a series of innovations from 2500 to 2530 to rebuilding developments in the Montauk, NY area. Among other works, the architects rerouted solar power to regenerate tree networks and designed elevated, rotating, large-scale aviaries that simulated migration-friendly climates. Historic bird populations were subsequently reintroduced from gene banks. The folder includes the original plans, small-scale models, and functional solar leaves.

 

Following a well-noted lawsuit, captured here, the Diller - von Furstenberg Family released the plans and agreed to match funding for public programs to install the solar leaves in the former Central Park area.
